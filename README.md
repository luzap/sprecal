# Sprecal
Sprecal (short for **sp**aced **re**call **cal**endar) is a utility designed to promote deeper long-term learning by seeking to recall learnt material multiple times separated by unequal intervals. 

Research in the mechanisms behind information retention have revealed the optimal way to keep data in memory for long periods of time is to review the material every so often, to strenghten the neural pathways leading to it. This tool was created with this information in mind, and since no other platform offered the same functionality in a convenient manner.
